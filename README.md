# Calculator
An arithmetic expression evaluator
This is my first project learning C++, so any tips or feedback would be appreciated.

At the moment this "Calculator" supports:
* Addition
* Substraction
* Multiplication
* Division
* Nested expressions
* Unary expressions

To-Do:

ðŸ”˜Add support for mod (%)

ðŸ”˜Add support for exponents (^)

ðŸ”˜Fix memory leaks using std::unique_ptr

ðŸ”˜Add REPL style input
